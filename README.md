# spatial-periphery-plots
# Introduction
This tool is used to give a good view of a dataset and tell all of the details and the periphery plots of the data. Based on the paper _Peripery Plots for Contextualizing Heterongenous Time-Based Charts_ by Bryce Morrow, Trevor Manz, Arlene E. Chung, Nils Gehlenborg, and David Gotz, we are making a tool to give a good detail view on the datset showing a focus and context view. The focus view will show the details of the dataset and the context zone will show the periphery plots. With this tool we will have all the data we need on datasets.
# Instructions
Download the Milestone1 branch to do testing and see progress. Once that is done, make sure all files were downloaded and open up index.html to see the page.
# Features
At its current state, we have a control map and a detail view. The control map shows the entire dataset based on how you us the detail view. The detail view currently allows you to move a rectangle on it where you are able to see different parts of the dataset. There are buttons underneath the control map where the user may zoom in and out, reset, pan left or right, and center the vision of the dataset based on the users preference. The user may also drag from the control map or detail view to move the dataset. If the user does not like where the detail view is, they may drag the detail view in a more preferable area on the page.
# Limitations
At its current state, the detail view is a rectangle instead of a circle and it is hard to move it. The detail view is also hard to drag to a different area on the page. Updates will be made to fix these and make it easier for the user and a better detail view with a context and focus zone is currently being made. The dataset that we currently have is just used for testing and is not the final dataset. A final dataset will be put in soon.
