# spatial-periphery-plots
# Introduction
This tool is used to give a good view of a dataset and tell all of the details and the periphery plots of the data. Based on the paper _Peripery Plots for Contextualizing Heterongenous Time-Based Charts_ by Bryce Morrow, Trevor Manz, Arlene E. Chung, Nils Gehlenborg, and David Gotz, we are making a tool to give a good detail view on the datset showing a focus and context view. The focus view will show the details of the dataset and the context zone will show the periphery plots. With this tool we will have all the data we need on datasets.
# Instructions
Download the Milestone1 branch to do testing and see progress. Once that is done, make sure all files were downloaded and open up index.html to see the page.
# Features
At its current state, we have a control map, a minimap, and a focus zone. The minimap shows the entire graph. It also has a circular mask that is used for the focus zone. The control map holds the focus zone where based on how the user drags the circular mask of the minimap, the focus zone will show a portion of the graph in better detail. There are buttons underneath the control map where the user may zoom in and out, reset, pan left or right, and center the vision of the dataset based on the users preference. The user can also move the graph from the focus zone instead of the circular mask if thew wish and may also move the minimap in any are they wish.
# Limitations
At its current state, the circular mask of the minimap is hard to move and doesn't exactly line up with the focus zone completely. The zooming is currently working on only a few parts. Updates will be made to fix these and make it easier for the user. At the moment, the focus zone is currently being made and will be finished soon.
